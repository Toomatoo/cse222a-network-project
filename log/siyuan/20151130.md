# Instrument Process:
    
Try to put Instrument Process on master/slave nodes.

    1. monitor the cpu/memory activity on nodes
    2. use hadoop shell command to get more detailed information

# SDN Controller

Collect information from Instrument Process

    1. Collect Info
    2. Store k-path to a node
    3. find a path with highest flow capacity

# My Method:

    1. Instrument predict start/end time for slave nodes
    2. SDN controller hold a network load graph
    3. SDN controller collect info from process and update the network load graph
    4. Modify routing according to the load graph
